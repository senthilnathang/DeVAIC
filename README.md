## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

**‚úÖ Current Status: All major compilation issues resolved!**

The project now compiles cleanly, but if you encounter issues:

**Basic Troubleshooting:**
```bash
# Verify clean compilation
cargo check

# Run tests to ensure everything works
cargo test

# Clean build if needed
cargo clean && cargo build --release
```

**Feature-Specific Issues:**
```bash
# IDE integration requires tokio
cargo build --release --features ide

# ML features require additional dependencies  
cargo build --release --features ml

# For development with all warnings fixed
RUSTFLAGS="-W unused" cargo build --release
```

**Performance Issues:**
- Use `--parallel` flag for large codebases
- Enable caching with `--enable-cache` for repeated analysis
- Adjust `--max-file-size` to skip very large files
- Use `--benchmark` to measure and optimize performance

### Runtime Issues

**Memory Usage:**
- Large codebases may require increasing system memory limits
- Use `--memory-limit` flag to control memory usage
- Enable parallel processing cautiously on memory-limited systems

**Language Support:**
- Ensure tree-sitter parsers are properly compiled
- Some languages require specific feature flags
- Check `cargo.toml` for language-specific dependencies
